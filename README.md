# Mumbo Jumbo

Mumbo Jumbo is a word scramble game primarily designed kids learning English as their first or second language. Word scramble games improve word recognition and reading speed in kids. They train language, memory, attention, logic at the same time. They are also used in dyslexia intervention, early reading programs and cognitive therapy. 

Despite the game being targeted towards kids, it is suitable for all ages and demographics.

Mumbo Jumbo is a slang term for "incomprehensible or unintelligible language", referring to the scrambled letters in a silly and fun way. 

# Game Structure
There are 4 levels in the game. 
In each level, the player should un-scramble 3 words before the time runs out.

Level 1 -> 3-letter words
Level 2 -> 4-letter words
Level 3 -> 5-letter words
Level 4 -> 6-letter words

For each word, the letters are draggend and dropped into the correct places (slots) with the mouse. 

The player starts a level by clicking the "START!" button. When this button is clicked, words become interactable and the timer starts.

There are "hint" buttons with the light-bulb icon next to each word. When clicked, the letters in correct places are painted with green, and letters in the wrong places are painted with red for a second.

After the player rearranges the words, they click the "Check Answers" button and the game evaluates the words. If a word is arranged correctly, a star icon appears next to it, and an evaluation text.

After a level is completed, the player clicks the "Next Level" button to move on to the next level.

After all 4 levels are complete, a screen showing the player's scores pops up, and the game ends.
