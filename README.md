# Mumbo Jumbo

Mumbo Jumbo is a word-scramble game primarily designed for kids learning English as their first or second language. Word-scramble games improve word recognition and reading speed in children. They train language, memory, attention, and logic at the same time. They are also used in dyslexia intervention, early reading programs, and cognitive therapy.

Although the game is targeted toward kids, it is suitable for all ages.

Mumbo jumbo is a slang term meaning “incomprehensible or unintelligible language,” referring to the the scrambled letters in a silly and fun way.

# Game Structure

There are 4 levels in the game. In each level, the player must unscramble 3 words before the timer runs out.

Level 1: 3-letter words
Level 2: 4-letter words
Level 3: 5-letter words
Level 4: 6-letter words

For each word, the letters are dragged and dropped into the correct slots using the mouse.

The player starts a level by clicking the “START!” button. When this button is clicked, the words become interactable and the timer begins.

Each word has a hint button (light-bulb icon). When clicked, letters in the correct position briefly turn green, and letters in the wrong position turn red.

After arranging the words, the player clicks the “Check Answers” button. Correctly arranged words show a star icon next to them, and an evaluation message appears.

After completing a level, the player clicks “Next Level” to continue.
After all four levels are finished, a score screen is displayed and the game ends.
